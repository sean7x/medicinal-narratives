I was terrified that I was ever in the position where I had to buy myself this pill. Long story short, the day after I ended my period, I had sex with my boyfriend and the condom slipped. It was my first month off birth control so I was very nervous. I ended up taking the pill 4-6 hours after the incident. We did a lot of research on it and I experienced a few symptoms within the next couple days such as nausea, a little bit of cramping, and I had an induced period from the pill a week later. It was like a regular period except it last roughly four days(short for me). Then the waiting began. I had nearly forgotten about it until I realized it was a past my normal expected period date. I began to panic, even though off my regular pill my periods are irregular. I read too many message boards about taking plan B and still getting pregnant and I had a lot of cry sessions because the only person I could talk to was my boyfriend. I then realized I hadn&#039;t been counting from the induced period date and having a normal cycle after that period. I was right on the edge of it being seven days past what my new expected date was and I started to panic again. Let me tell you, it was the most welcomed pain in the world when I finally got it eight days past the expected date a month after the induced period. I had bad cramping for a week leading up to it and really painful cramps the day of. I think stress played a huge role in delaying my period also because I was thinking about it every second of every day. My advice is to try to relax, take a deep breathe, and let the medicine do its job.

I went to a doctor who told me the Norcos were causing the pain now and I needed to get off. Skeptical but hopeful I tried the doc&#039;s plan. First 3 days I was on Subutex which I started as soon as my withdrawals started and it took 2 pills before my withdrawals stopped after about 10 minutes. I continued on that dose for 2 more days and then started Suboxone strips and after about 6 months my doc switched me to Zubsolv. I cut down Zubsolv, as tolerable, from 2 pills a day to a quarter pill then quit. 4 days later I think I&#039;m feeling a lot better but I still need more time to normalize.

{"Unnamed: 0":76689,"drugName":"Lorcaserin","condition":"Weight Loss","review":"\"I started to use Belviq in early 2016. After two bottles, I stopped taking the pills because I was not losing weight and thought I was amongst the group of &quot;non-responders.&quot; I decided to consult my doctor once again and expressed how I wanted to try something else. At that point, he told me Belviq released an extended release formula. Today January 7, 2017, I have been on Belviq XR for 14 days. My starting weight was 180lbs., I am down to 166lbs. I lost 14 pounds. I am eating less, and getting full quicker. It is good to note, I was under the weather and my diet became chicken noodle soup for 5 out of the 10 days since beginning BelviqXR. I am completely satisfied and I highly recommend it.\"","rating":10,"date":1483747200000,"usefulCount":1}

I honestly got very scared after reading so many negative reviews that I almost didnt take it. But I did and I am very pleased with my experience.\r\n\r\nI am 27 and one of the main factors for me choosing birth control was that I began working out a lot and started having a period 2 times a month which I hated. I take my pill at 10 PM each night and have never had any nausea, weight gain, pimples or negative side effects. I am an emotional person so honestly I cant give feedback on if it has affected my emotions. Regardless I have not experienced any extreme changes in myself. I&#039;m on pack 2 and I love having a shorter period. I recommend this birth control.\"","rating":10,"date":1338336000000,"usefulCount":2}
{"Unnamed: 0":67100,"drugName":"Magnesium hydroxide","condition":"Constipation","review":"\"I changed my diet about 6 months ago and just recently (the last month or so) have been experiencing constipation. Before this it had been very few and far between.  Roughly every 3-4 days is when I would have a BM, not comfortable at all.  I finally caved after having horrible bloating and pain at work today.  I went to the drug store and picked up a bottle of MOM.  I took 2 tbsp about 7pm.  I didn&#039;t have any discomfort or gas but I couldn&#039;t sleep very well either. Finally about 1am, the blockage is gone and I&#039;m so much more comfortable.  I didn&#039;t experience any cramping and the beginning was still somewhat difficult to pass, it was soft but very bulky still.  I don&#039;t feel any further urges to go to the toilet but it&#039;s only been 20 minutes.\"","rating":10,"date":1478736000000,"usefulCount":13}

After I took the 2nd pill, I got severe shortness of breath, chest pain, high fever and diarrhea. Although not as bad as the first day, the symptoms continued into the second day of taking them. On the 3rd day, out of the blue, my vision was blurred\/impeded by what I can only describe as bursts of light\/sunbursts for about 20 minutes followed by severe headache and fatigue. Very scary! My bladder feels a bit better so I decided to stop the medication after only 3 days. Will ask the doctor for something else with less side effects if it continues.\"","rating":4,"date":1459382400000,"usefulCount":19}

My first stab at a TNF inhibitor went well for about a year. Then, there were a couple of tries with different meds (including the dreaded prednisone for flares). My PA thought that we could &quot;do better&quot;.....so, I researched and she researched....together, we came up with Actemra.  The stiffness in the morning is GONE!  I haven&#039;t flared in over a year!  I&#039;m SO lucky to have found Actemra.\r\nThe only thing that kind of bugs me, is that the week before my next infusion is due, I get a little stiff and more tired than usual.\"","rating":9,"date":1364428800000,"usefulCount":144}

I have been on Depo for about 2\/3 years now, and frankly, I don&#039;t fault Depo for the &quot;side effects&quot; I have experienced. Yes, I have gained some weight. But I also eat a lot of carbs and don&#039;t exercise nearly as much as I used to. So you can&#039;t blame Depo for that. Also, my doctor made it quite clear to me that Depo could affect my bone density, so I take a chewable calcium supplement every day, and so far my bones are in great shape. And let&#039;s talk about the number one life changer- no period! I used to have awful cramps and heavy bleeding, but now I literally have no period whatsoever. Occasional spotting, but that&#039;s really rare and only lasts for a day. do yourself a favor and try Depo\"","rating":9,"date":1351987200000,"usefulCount":12}

Throughout school he was dazed and tired.  He didn&#039;t find anything to laugh about and seemed out of it.  During the third week (the 3mg dosage) his therapist took him off.

{"Unnamed: 0":67594,"drugName":"Plan B","condition":"Emergency Contraception","review":"\"Ladies please note- bone of the ways plan b works is to PREVENT ovulation, so in simple terms, if you have already ovulated- it can be useless! That isn&#039;t something that was disclosed to me, &amp; most people have no idea! It&#039;s a catch 22 because you can usually only get pregnant when you ovulate ..anyways.. I had sex once, I took it 12 hrs after unprotected sex. Ended up getting PREGNANT. I must have already ovulated.Then I later had a miscarriage(chemical pregnancy) b\/c the way my doctor explained it, plan b does three things: \r\n1. Prevent ovulation\r\n2. Thicken cervical fluid (stops spermies)\r\n3. Thins lining of uterus to prevent egg implanting\r\nI had a miscarriage b\/c the egg was never able to implant. I feel horribly about it today &amp; wanted to share, hope this helps\"","rating":1,"date":1495929600000,"usefulCount":15}
